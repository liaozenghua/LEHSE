[{"title": "How to Sell Fine Art Online", "text": "title: How to Sell Fine Art Online\npart: Steps\nheadline: Sell yourself first.\ntext: Before doing anything else, stop and sum up yourself as an artist. Now, think about how to translate that to an online profile. Be it the few words, Twitter allows you or an entire page of indulgence that your own website would allow you. Bring out the most salient features of your creativity, your experience, your passion, and your reasons for painting. Make it clear to readers why you are an artist who loves art, produces high quality art, and is a true champion of art. If you're not great with words, find a friend who can help you with this really important aspect of selling online \u2013 the establishment of your credibility and reliability.\nheadline: Join online artist communities.\ntext: Depending on what scale you intend to sell your art pieces, you may want to get an account on an online art community or store, like Deviant Art. With 15% -20\u00a0% brokerage, you can also find many online art galleries like Art Brokerage, Diva Art Group, or Saatchi Art that will show your artwork online and sell them to the buyer in completely secured transaction. There are also many other possible sites, such as Etsy (heavier on the crafts but still arty), eBay (auction site), an Amazon store (an online store platform), CafePress (for printing your artwork onto stuff like mugs), Craigslist (general classifieds), and quite a lot of other artwork based sales sites (do a general search).\nRead the terms and conditions of every site very carefully. Know what commission or percentage the site takes, know what protections (or lack of them) that the site offers, know what clientele generally peruse the site, know the general sales brought in by the site, know everything you can that is relevant to your sales.\nIf your goal is to turn your art into an investment property, then selling online is likely to be a much longer path to this end. This is largely because it is generally more difficult for unknown artists to secure higher priced sales with serious collectors online than it is through a traditional gallery where such concrete decisions can be made safely. It is best to see selling art online as an adjunct to your usual methods of selling art, not your only means.\nheadline: Make yourself public.\ntext: Get yourself out there as best as you can by advertising yourself. Publish some \"example\" pieces around the web to show what you can do and to demonstrate your style. Be sure to add a watermark to your digital version to protect your artwork from art thieves.\nSpend a little time researching online the ways in which other artists are promoting themselves. What works for them and what doesn't? What do you like about their promotional strategies and what do you want to avoid? This type of research can give you a lot of ideas and also alert you to potential pitfalls for the ways in which you will promote your own artwork. Bookmark the sites of artists selling online that really inspire you, so that you can come back to them regularly to see how they're evolving and succeeding.\nSeize the power of Twitter and Facebook to increase people's knowledge of you. Tweet updates about your new paintings, your thoughts about art, and news items about art in general. On Facebook, place photos of your artwork, (digitally watermarked), photos of you receiving awards, and information about your art, artwork in general, and perhaps even some critiques of artwork.\nheadline: Blog about your artwork.\ntext: Given the hundreds of free blogging websites, you have a lot of choice in keeping a blog. Most importantly, it's extremely useful to keep it updated regularly - this gives people something \"pretty to look at\", and a story to follow as your reputation increases and your sales story grows. A blog can pick up a lot of hits from search engines if you utilize the keywords feature accurately; use it to your advantage. Be sure to name your blog something simple but memorable \u2013 you'll want people to be able to find you with ease.\nRead How to start a blog and How to increase website traffic for free for assistance.\nA good way to test keywords for very little cost is through using an auction site. Play around with the words you use to title your art sales, as well as the words used within the body of the text. Keep changing the words until you find the sweet spot \u2013 words that really do seem to attract the most views.\nheadline: Create a mailing list.\ntext: This could be your most effective tool if managed well. For every sale you make, every person who sends you an email that might be interested, get all of their email addresses in digital database ready for mass emailing. At designated intervals (once a month, every other week, whenever you start a new series) send them all nice, grammatically correct, friendly emails, complete with a neatly set-out portfolio of the pictures of your recent work (a PDF can work well for this purpose). This keeps you on the radar of past customers, which is important. And if it's a really wonderful newsletter, you might get lucky and they might send it to all of their friends as well \u2013 then even more eyes are seeing your work!\nEvery thoughtful mailing list includes an opt-out option. Don't be threatened by this; see it as good housekeeping and as retaining the clients who really do want to see your items. You're not online to hassle people who aren't interested!\nheadline: Take good pictures.\ntext: Like they say, \"a picture's worth a thousand words\" and you'll want your impression on potential customers to be good. Show detail, right down to paint strokes and paint type. Be willing to show potential buyers multiple shots of your work under different light, hung on a wall, etc. This may be the only way to alleviate the justifiable fear many people have of buying a work of art that they have never seen in person.\nBear in mind that not everyone has a good internet connection. Balance great photos with ease of downloading time. Talk to a web specialist if you're not sure what to do.\nFor more photography tips of relevance, read How to take better product photographs for free and How to take catalog photos.\nheadline: Be sure to properly license your art.\ntext: Licensing art is a way of proving what belongs to whom. It is a necessary bookkeeping in the arts department and will help you if there is a dispute about originality, ownership, or moral rights.\nheadline: Consider the option of creating your own site.\ntext: Having your own site means that you can optimize every page for search engines and it sets you apart from the many artists who only use general art sales sites. Having your own website means that the viewer is not distracted by other artists and their work whilst browsing your art and your own name is likely to gain in reputation faster. You can sell directly from your site via email correspondence with potential buyers (ask them to contact you for prices, to make a purchase etc.).\nIf you're serious about selling your art online with your own site, then it's essential with a domain name that is either your own name or the name that you want people to associate you with your art. For example, you could use a domain made up of your first and last name such as firstnamelastname.com or if you work under a pseudonym then you could use a domain name using that i.e. pseudonym.com.\nGive serious consideration to making your website as much like a virtual art gallery as possible. Encourage potential clients to wander through and see your paintings in a leisurely, gallery-like manner to increase their viewing enjoyment.\nAdd prices and contact details. People want to see the price, so don't hide it or expect the customer to come up with one for you. And be available to answer their questions in a timely fashion.\nWhen creating your own website, you need to find a secure method for accepting payment and you might even consider implementing an escrow system. The more expensive your artwork is, the more careful you will need to be about money handling, including acceptance of returns and refunds. There are various methods in existence online for the safe transference of money; do your research to find out what works best for your local needs and for your global market.\nheadline: Expect this to be a gradual process and don't expect to sell a lot right away.\ntext: An online art business needs to be built up little by little. It's much the same as putting together a company (indeed, you should treat your online art sales as a business) \u2013 you will try to make your name known, or at least give people a hint on who you are as an artist, develop your services as you grow, and gain in reputation as time goes on. It may feel like a long time at the beginning but solid and patient foundations will set you up for a good future, as well as maintaining a positive attitude about what you're doing.\nAttend as many relevant art shows to show your work as you can. If the shows are juried, display the awards your art has won as part of your profiles or website backgrounds."}, {"title": "How to Be Well Read", "text": "title: How to Be Well Read\npart: Reading the Classics\nheadline: Read the classics before 1600.\ntext: Reading the classics is the very first thing you have to do to be well-read. If you want to build a solid foundation for your understanding of the books you read, then you can't avoid some of the earliest plays, poems, and oral tales ever written down. Remember that the novel didn't really get popular until the 18th century, so you won't find novels on this list. Without reading the poetry of Homer or the plays of Sophocles, you won't be able to call yourself well-read. Here's a list to get you started:\nThe Epic of Gilgamesh (Unknown author) (18th \u2013 17th century BCE)\nThe Iliad and The Odyssey by Homer (850\u2013750 BCE, 8th century BCE)\n\"The Oresteia\" by Aeschylus (458 BCE)\nOedipus the King by Sophocles (430 BCE)\nMedea by Euripides (431 BCE)\nAeneid by Virgil (29\u201319 BCE)\nOne Thousand and One Nights (Unknown author) (700\u20131500)\nBeowulf (Unknown author) (975-1025)\nThe Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu (11th century)\nThe Divine Comedy by Dante (1265\u20131321)\nThe Decameron by Boccaccio (1349\u201353)\nThe Canterbury Tales by Chaucer (14th century)\nheadline: Read the classics from 1600-1913.\ntext: Though a large amount of material is covered in these measly 300 years, reading the books from the time period when the novel emerged until the beginning of World War I will give you a sense of the progress that the novel and other works had made throughout the Romantic and Victorian periods, as well as an understanding of the realism that was the traditional mode for novels which was then turned on its head with the advent of Modernism and the disillusionment that came from WWI. Here's a list to get you started:\nDon Quixote by Cervantes 1605 (part 1), 1615 (part 2)\n\"Taming of the Shrew,\" Romeo and Juliet, \"A Midsummer Night's Dream,\" \"The Merchant of Venice,\" \"Much Ado About Nothing,\" \"As You Like It,\" \"Julius Caesar,\" Hamlet, \"Othello,\" \"King Lear,\" and \"Macbeth\" by William Shakespeare (1593, 1594, 1595, 1596, 1598, 1599, 1599, 1600, 1604, 1605, 1605)\nGulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift (1726)\nPride and Prejudice by Jane Austen (1813)\nFaust by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1832)\nLe P\u00e8re Goriot by Honor\u00e9 de Balzac (1835)\nDead Souls by Nikolai Gogol (1842)\nWuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb (1847)\nMoby-Dick by Herman Melville (1851)\nMadame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert (1856)\nGreat Expectations by Charles Dickens (1861)\nWar and Peace and Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy (1869, 1877)\nHeart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad (1899)\nCrime and Punishment and The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoevsky (1866, 1880)\nMiddlemarch by George Eliot (1871)\nheadline: Read the classics from 1914-1995.\ntext: This time period spans the advent of Modernism, an experimental form of fiction, as well as a rebellion against traditional narratives. Reading the classics of this time period will help you gain an understanding of the dramatic transformation of literature in the 20th century. Here's a list to get you going:\nIn Search of Lost Time by Marcel Proust (1913\u201327)\nUlysses by James Joyce (1922)\nThe Magic Mountain by Thomas Mann (1924)\nThe Great Gatsby by F.

For short stories, it's more important to read the works of a particular author than a collection, so here is a list of classic short story writers as well as more contemporary writers that you have to check out:\nClassic short story masters (1600-1950): Edgar Allan Poe, Anton Chekhov, Ernest Hemingway, Jorge Luis Borges, Kafka, Isaac Babel, John Updike, Katherine Mansfield, Eudora Welty, and Ray Bradbury.\nContemporary short story masters: (1950-Present): Flannery O'Connor, Raymond Carver, Donald Barthelme, Tim 'O Brien, George Saunders, Jhumpa Lahiri, Junot Diaz, Z.Z.

Though Shakespeare is the playwright you should know the best, he has been previously listed. However, there are other contemporary and not-so-contemporary plays that you should read if you want to call yourself well-read. Check these out:\nEverything by Shakespeare, including Macbeth, Romeo and Juliet, and Much Ado About Nothing (1606, 1597, 1599)\nHedda Gabler and A Doll's House by Henrik Ibsen (1890, 1879)\nThe Importance of Being Earnest by Oscar Wilde (1895)\nCyrano de Bergerac by Edmund Rostand (1897)\nThe Cherry Orchard and Uncle Vanya by Chekhov (1904, 1897)\nPygmalion by George Bernard Shaw (1912)\nOur Town by Thornton Wilder (1938)\nDeath of a Salesman and The Crucible by Arthur Miller (1949, 1953)\nWaiting for Godot by Samuel Beckett (1949)\nTwelve Angry Men by Reginald Rose (1954)\nA Streetcar Named Desire, The Glass Menagerie, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof by Tennessee Williams (1947, 1944, 1955)\nNo Exit by John-Paul Sartre (1944)\nInherit the Wind by Jerome Lawrence (1955)\nLong Day's Journey into Night and The Iceman Cometh by Eugene O'Neill (1956, 1946)\nA Raisin in the Son by Lorraine Hansberry (1959)\nWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? by Edward Albee (1963)\nRosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead by Tom Stoppard (1966)\nBetrayal by Harold Pinter (1978)\nheadline: Read poetry.\ntext: Though the people around you may be less likely to talk about poetry unless you run in well-read circles, it's important to familiarize yourself with both classic and contemporary poets so that you can be part of the conversation.

You'll have to read some non-fiction too so that you know what's going on in the world of politics, history, popular science, and whatever the heck else is going on in the world. Here are the different types of non-fiction that you should familiarize yourself with:\nHistory\nPolitics\nMagazines\nMemoirs\nBiographies\nThe news\nheadline: Read popular fiction and non-fiction.\ntext: If you really want to know what everyone is talking about, then you can't just sit around reading Virgil. You'll have to know what's going on in the modern world too, and to read those beach reads or plane reads or Oprah's book club has been talking about. How do you know what to read?

Well, because you'll feel good about yourself if you accomplish something, that's why. Start small: say, you want to read one book a month. Then go down to a book every two weeks. When you're officially addicted to reading, you can read one book a week -- or even two. Make a list of books and stick to them and you'll be reading more and more in no time at all.\nSetting goals will also keep you from wasting your time in less productive endeavors. Let's say you've aimed to finish Ulysses by the weekend but there's a marathon of Bad Girls Club on. Bye bye bad girls, hello culture.\nheadline: Blaze through top 100 lists.\ntext: The Modern Library, Amazon, Time Magazine, and the New York Times have some great top 100 lists that can make you feel even more accomplished for reading.

Check out these lists for more reference:\nThe Modern Library Top 100 Modern Books list.Time Magazine's Best Book of All Time list.The Guardian's Top 100 Books of All Time list.Read books by Nobel-prize winning authors. Check out the list of authors here:The Village Voice's list of best books of the previous decade, by genre.\nheadline: Listen to audio books.\ntext: Open an account at Audible.com or start listening to books you've rented from your local library. Listening to audiobooks is a great way to be well-read when you're too tired to pick up a book and read. You can also listen to the books in the car, which is perfect for a long commute, or on your iPod while you're taking a walk. Suddenly you'll be looking forward to that long drive to work instead of dreading it!\nBefore you buy or rent the book, see if you can listen to a sample to make sure you like the voice of the person who is reading. If you think the person has an annoying voice, the book will feel like a slow read.\nheadline: Get a Kindle.\ntext: Though a Kindle can cost over $100, you'll quickly save money when you start buying books at the discount rate it offers. You can buy many classic novels, such as the works of Henry James, for under one dollar, and you can get contemporary novels at a 10-25% discount from what you would pay in the store, depending on the book. Getting a Kindle will also allow you to download a book the second you have a reading craving, instead of waiting around for a convenient time to run to the store.\nWhen you have a Kindle, you can also sample a chapter of a book before buying it, so you can still browse the books a bit.\nheadline: Reward yourself with fun books.\ntext: Though being well-read is important, having fun when you're reading is important too. What's your vice--cheesy detective novels, Harlequin romances, or thrillers? Whatever books you really love to read, don't give 'em up just to read Charles Dickens. Instead, reward yourself: say that for every classic novel or literary novel you read, you'll get to read one thriller, one beach romance, or one book of whatever genre you love the most.\nheadline: Start or join a book club.\ntext: Being part of a book club will not only help you make friends with other well-read people, but it will open you up to a wider variety of books and will give you strict deadlines for finishing the books, as well as some time to think about what the books mean to you. Book clubs will keep you from speeding from one book to the next without stopping to think what it all means.\nIn most book clubs, you'll have a chance to pick a book for the club to read, so you'll get to share one of your favorite authors with others.\nheadline: Start a Goodreads account.\ntext: If you start an account on Goodreads, you'll be able to make a list of all the books you've read or want to read, review the books you've read, and to interact with other book lovers. Starting an account is free and will connect you to even more books and more readers. And more importantly, it'll make you more excited about reading, so start an account today!\nheadline: Become an Amazon top reviewer.\ntext: Get an account at Amazon if you don't have one already and start reviewing all of those great books you've read. Once you've reviewed a ton of books and have written interesting and thoughtful reviews, you'll be on your way to reaching top reader status. If you do make it to top reader, you'll get perks like discounts, and the ability to read books before their official release date.\nAnd even if you don't become a top reader, taking the time to review the books you've read will help you think about what you've read.\nheadline: Hang out with other well-read people.\ntext: Just hanging out with people who love to read, whether they're your co-workers or members of your book club, will open you up to more ideas of what books to read next, and will give you a better sense of which books are popular. There's no point in being well-read if you can't use your knowledge to have interesting discussions with other people.\nheadline: Listen to podcasts.\ntext: You can download free podcasts, such as the New Yorker Fiction podcasts, or KCRW's weekly Bookworm podcasts, to hear writers read from their favorite stories or to hear authors discuss their new books. You can also get your news from podcasts, and listen anything from Chekhov's stories to classic speeches in American history, such as the Gettysburg address. Try these podcasts to become more well-read without reading a word:\nThe New Yorker Fiction podcast\nKCRW's Bookworm\nPRI's Selected Shorts\nWBEZ Chicago's This American Life\nPRI's America Abroad\nLearnOutLoud's Great Speeches in History Podcast\nNew York Times Book Review podcast"}]
